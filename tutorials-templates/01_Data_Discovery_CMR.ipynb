        "\n",
        "In this tutorial you will learn:\n",
        "- what CMR is;  \n",
        "- how to use the `requests` package to search data collections and granules;  \n",
        "- how to parse the results of these searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We will focus on datasets in the cloud.  Currently, DAACs with data in the cloud are 'ASF', 'GES_DISC', 'GHRC_DAAC', 'LPCLOUD', 'ORNL_CLOUD', 'POCLOUD'\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is CMR\n",
        "CMR is the Common Metadata Repository.  It catalogs all data for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).  It is the backend of [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), the GUI search interface you are probably familiar with.  More information about CMR can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the GUI for Earthdata Search is not accessible from a cloud instance - at least not without some work.  Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible.  What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search.  This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search.  You could make typos or other mistakes.  A cleaner, reproducible solution is to search CMR programmatically using the CMR API.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is the CMR API\n",
        "API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It allows applications (software, services, etc) to send information to each other.  A helpful analogy is a waiter in a restaurant.  The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to search CMR from Python\n",
        "The first step is to import python packages.  We will use:  \n",
        "- `requests` This package does most of the work for us accessing the CMR API using HTTP methods. \n",
        "- `pprint` to _pretty print_ the results of the search.  \n",
